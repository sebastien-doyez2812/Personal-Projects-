# Personal-Projects-
This repository will contain the code of my personal project. 

I) The kibble dispenser:
  This is a project where I create a kibble dispenser for my cat. 
  All I needed:
    _  Arduino Uno
    _ LCD screen ( using in I2C)
    _ 1 servomotor
It works like a clock, when it is 8 am or 12 am or 6 pm, It gives some food, using the servomotor.
